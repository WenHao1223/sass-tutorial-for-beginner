Learn about the basics of Sass such as Sass variables, maps, nesting, functions, mixins, extending, and operations

In this course, you will learn the basics of Sass. We will start with a brief overview of what Sass is along with what is required to incorporate Sass into your environment. We will also set up a Sass compiler in Visual Studio Code. You will learn about Sass variables, maps, nesting, functions, mixins, extending, and operations.  Lastly, we will start from scratch on a real-world project (Portfolio website) using Sass. We will go step-by-step through each part, and at the end, we will deploy the site.
